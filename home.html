        <!--About Me-->
        <div class="p-2">
          <p>It is so tempting to decide that these questions and others like them are pointless. Unfortunately most of us cannot stop ourselves from asking such questions. The persistent needling of these questions makes us anxious and too often unproductive.</p>
          <p>I will not sufficiently answer these broad concerns, and these questions will continue. However, through working with me, and being listened to the questions may change and the horizon may become sharper.</p>

          <p>I incesantly propose that things can be different. That is my job: to turn things another way to wonder about new meanings for what may seem to be tired thoughts. Treatment could be something  else than what psychotherapy has been in the past. This should be an investigation pointed finding a dynamic, a strong force, working behind the scenes in your life.</p>

          <p>My role is to listen in order to hear the full weight of what, the people who come to see me, have to say. By listening I aid their exploration of the dynamic behind their current thoughts and feelings.</p>

          <p>The treatment must be a collaboration adapted to the specific needs of those who come to work with me.</p>

          <h1>My Background and Training</h1>

          <p>I hold a doctorate in clinical psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley. I trained in child therapy at the Ann Martin Children’s Center I continued on to work with mothers and their babies at the Infant Parent Program. At the Westside Crisis Clinic in San Francisco I trained in crisis work and in the treatment of severe mental illness. I extended my crisis work with severe cases for many years at Berkeley Mental Health.</p>

          <p>I am a member of the Ecole Freudian du Quebec where my training in a rigorous and effective form of psychoanalysis is on going. I am a founding member of the California Circle of the Ecole Freudian du Quebec. I have attended the yearly seminar given by the analysts of GIFRIC Apollon, Bergeron and Cantin since 1999.</p>

      <!--My Approach-->
      <div id="approach" class="p-2">
        <h1>My Approach</h1>
        <p> The treatment is aimed the discovery of something beyond who we think we are.  Instead of a beginning that stares at the predictable causes, of life’s difficulties, I help people look for clues in dreams, disjointed impressions and the odd bits of evidence. Evidence which points to the fact that the locus of control in every life lies outside of the logical mind. When well examined, these evidences combine to form an edifice of knowledge which can be liberating.</p>
        <p>Here are a few more of my thoughts, which address more specifically, the general problems people bring to the work I do with them.</p>
        <h5>Depression:</h5>
        <p>Freud described depression as a shadow that falls across a person’s life. The shadow falling in a way that makes everything darker for that person. The solution as to why this happens for some requires a very precise understanding of what is happening inside the person at a very deep level. One must understand not only that this darkness obscuring one’s life, there also need to be an accounting of how this shadow is cast. Ultimately, one needs to arrive at a knowledge about this dynamic that has shut out the light</p>
        <h5>Trauma:</h5>
        <p>Trauma shatters a person’s world in a way that words can not describe. What needs to be done is to give you the words that have yet to appear to help you understand what has happened. </p>
        <h5>Anxiety:</h5>
        <p>This causes a variety of Symptoms including: Sleeplessness and self soothing activities such as over drinking and over eating, substance abuse. These behavioral manifestations of serious problems disturb and disrupt your progress in life. Ultimately, Anxiety is an uneasiness which permeates everything.  Therapy is motivated by a wish for quietude driven by the discomfort  of Anxiety.</p>

      <!--Couples Therapy-->
      <div id="couples" class="ct p-2">
        <h1>Working Toward a Couple</h1>
        <p>Do you imagine...</p>
        <p>Your partner and yourself sitting on a sofa, together, in the same room, trying to describe what the last few months have been like? Do you flash on the danger that you might hit a nerve as you speak, creating a larger problem you will just have to deal with on the way home, or never?</p>
        <p>Couples Therapy can be like that...</p>
        <p>There is a way that resolving problems in an intimate relationship can be done differently, through psychotherapy. For many couples a team approach can be effective where the standard sort of couples work may fail.</p>
        <p>With my associates I can put together a team that allows each member of a couple to have the space needed in order to say what they will and to think clearly about their needs and desires within the relationship but without the other present. The treatment often accelerates as each knows that the other is also at work on the problem. Either a standard couples therapy approach or a team effort. I am happy to consider either approach with a couple.</p>

      <!--Children's Therapy-->
      <div id="play-t"class="p-2">
        <h1>Play Therapy</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Fighting</li>
          <li>Disobedience</li>
          <li>Poor attention at school</li>
          <li>Teasing</li>
          <li>Bullying</li>
          <li>Boredom</li>
          <li>No interest in anything</li>
          <li>Back talk</li>
          <li>Dangerous play</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is going on? Is there no solution to these problems? Or rather is the only solution to put your child on psychiatric medication?</p>
        <p>Could a child make use of play therapy considering how bad things have become? </p>
        <p>Play therapy gives the child a space both temporal and physical in which he or she may discover and express thoughts and feelings which illuminate those things pressing on their lives. Play therapy is different from other play because it is watched and responded to, interpreted both to the child and to you. In a effective treatment a child will understand they have become the instructor, the teacher with me as their audience attempting to learn what the child needs to say. As the therapy progresses the therapist will report to the parents or care giver on the progress of the child and often be able to offer insight into how this child is managing. The treatment is a partnership with the child at the center of a system devised to make sense of  a world that has thus far eluded meaning.</p>
        <h5>Some of the problems that can be addressed in play therapy include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The death of parents</li>
          <li>Trauma</li>
          <li>Divorce</li>
          <li>Abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The horror and sadness some children endure is awful to consider. Doing nothing only perpetuates the injustice. The fact of these problems underscores the seriousness of this form of treatment and the great many things at stake in all play therapies.</p>

      <!--Infant Parent-->

        <h1>Something For You and Your Baby</h1>
        <p>Infant parent psychotherapy is a treatment constructed to give you a place to start understanding this new life, your baby, and the importance this new person has for you. Infant-Parent psychotherapy offers a place for you to consider meaning with your child as your relationship grows.</p>
        <p>This treatment is often short term with the goal of giving your most important thoughts and feelings a place they might now otherwise have during what is most usually the chaotic beginning of life in our world.</p>
